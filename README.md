I do small and minimalist solutions 

Zig is a pretty capable and expressive language. Its possible to provide solutions to common problems in a very small amount of code (sometimes), especially if you embrace comptime.

There are many common problem domains out there, with many common solutions in a range of languages. These libraries can sometimes be quite large, complicated, and take effort to understand the internals. 

Rather than write a direct port of these existing Go/Java/Rust/C++ utils into Zig .. it can pay to relax and do things the Zig way instead

Until Zig 1.0 lands, all my working repos are based on nightly master
